libev is a high-performance event loop/event model with lots of features.

   Libev is modelled (very losely) after libevent and the Event perl
   module, but is faster, scales better and is more correct, and also more
   featureful. And also smaller. Yay.

   Some of the specialties of libev not commonly found elsewhere are:
   
   - extensive and detailed, readable documentation (not doxygen garbage).
   - fully supports fork, can detect fork in various ways and automatically
     re-arms kernel mechanisms that do not support fork.
   - highly optimised select, poll, epoll, kqueue and event ports backends.
   - filesystem object (path) watching (with optional linux inotify support).
   - wallclock-based times (using absolute time, cron-like).
   - relative timers/timeouts (handle time jumps).
   - fast intra-thread communication between multiple
     event loops (with optional fast linux eventfd backend).
   - extremely easy to embed (fully documented, no dependencies,
     autoconf supported but optional).
   - very small codebase, no bloated library, simple code.
   - fully extensible by being able to plug into the event loop,
     integrate other event loops, integrate other event loop users.
   - very little memory use (small watchers, small event loop data).
   - optional C++ interface allowing method and function callbacks
     at no extra memory or runtime overhead.
   - optional Perl interface with similar characteristics (capable
     of running Glib/Gtk2 on libev).
   - support for other languages (multiple C++ interfaces, D, Ruby,
     Python) available from third-parties.

   Examples of programs that embed libev: the EV perl module, node.js,
   auditd, rxvt-unicode, gvpe (GNU Virtual Private Ethernet), the
   Deliantra MMORPG server (http://www.deliantra.net/), Rubinius (a
   next-generation Ruby VM), the Ebb web server, the Rev event toolkit.

Compile for ANDROID
1. make tool chain for build android platfomr
$ ${ANDROID_NDK}/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --platform=${APP_PLATFORM} -toolchain=$ANDROID_NDK/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9 --arch=${ANDROID_NDK}/platforms/${APP_PLATFORM}/${ARCH} --install-dir=${OUTPUT_DIR}

e.g:
~/android-ndk-r14b/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --platform=android-9 -toolchain=arm-linux-androideabi-4.8 --arch=arm --install-dir=~/android-ndk-r14b/alone-toolchain/

2. Setting environment variable
$ cd ${OUTPUT_DIR}
$ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin

3. Use arm-linux-androideabi-4.8 confiure libev with "-DANDROID" CPPFILAGS.
$ cd ~/code/libev
$ CPPFLAGS+="-DANDROID" ./configure --host=arm-linux-androideabi --prefix=`pwd`/android/arm

4. the lib is in the ~/code/libev/.libs director, it looks like the --prefix doesn't make difference.
